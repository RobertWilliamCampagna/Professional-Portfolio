<h2>About<br> Me</h2>
<p>
Robert William Campagna. born on Long Island, NY.  I will tell you all a story, how having surprise twins can save your life.  I was unprepared.  For the twins yes, but also for what happened to me  six months after they were born.  I needed a second job, and by not getting a job
at my favorite donut shop for the overnight shift, I had no prior experience in making yeast rise, I decided with the extra time I will start playing baseball again after a ten year break.  Bad idea.  My third game back I was pitching and I broke my arm in half longways, think about that.  It was like taking a piece of celery and twisting it, thats how my break was.
I broke my humerus while throwing a fastball...felt like my arm got shot off my a bazooka.  Anyway, I had to tell my job that I hurt myself playing baseball.  Thank God my boss was an ex major league baseball player so he could undertand the pain I was going through.  I had to leave my job of being Optimus Prime at Universal Studios for a hard nine month recovery.  I had surgery, the doctor put a metal bar and ten screws in my arm, and oh boy it feels like it.  
During my rehab I saw a bunch of doctors that didn't like the fact my arm broke throwing a baseball so they sent me out for many tests.  Turns out I had thyriod cancer and I needed half my thyroid removed.  Took care of that real quick, got my job back as Optimus, but guess what?  Still not enough money to support a family, so thats why I am here trying to get a new wanted skill so I can go out and get a good job for my family :) thats it...this was like therapy.  Now enjoy the picture of a light house on the very eastern tip of Long Island, and two Mr. Potato heads that one of my sons Welsey built.
